Mediawiki Upgrade-as-a-Service

A semester-project for Institut Eurecom (http://www.eurecom.fr/). Aims to demonstrate an online-upgrade of a popular web-service (Wikipedia) with a major database-schema change without downtime use.

Check out the project report in the /doc/ -folder for a summary of work. A demonstration of the software should be coming soon...
